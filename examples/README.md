# Basic Example App for UAL with PlainJS

This example demonstrates an implementation of the [Universal Authenticator Library Renderer for PlainJS](https://github.com/EOSIO/ual-plainjs-renderer) in a simple EOS transfer DAPP.  It uses the [UAL for Scatter Authenticator](https://github.com/EOSIO/ual-scatter).

# About EOSIO Labs

EOSIO Labs repositories are experimental.  Developers in the community are encouraged to use EOSIO Labs repositories as the basis for code and concepts to incorporate into their applications.

## Setup
```bash
yarn
cp default.env .env

The example application uses an environment configuration for the chain and rpc endpoints.  Update the values in the ``.env`` file you created in the first step to point the application at your preferred chain and run the example.

## Environment Defaults
The ``.env`` file that is generated from the first step has the following defaults:
```
CHAIN_ID=12345
RPC_PROTOCOL=https
RPC_HOST=api.example.net
RPC_PORT=443
```

## Run the example
```bash
yarn example
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the example application
